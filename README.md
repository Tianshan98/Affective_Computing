# Affective_Computing
Coursework

Concerning such a serious situation, nowadays there are various applications (APP) like
My Safetipin: Personal Safety Women Safety App,Women Safety,Watch.Me, etc. and devices
like Athena [2] and Aware360 [3] to ensure womenâ€™s safety. These applications and devices, to
some extent, can protect women from that violence. However, some obvious flaws highly
limit the application of them in practice. For example, some wearable devices can only
make noticeable noise or contact the emergency contacts by manually shaking these devices,
similarly, some of the APPs even need the user to unlock the phone and launch the APP. On
the other hand, although some devices can automatically detect dangers via the change of
heart rate, the low accuracy may cause misjudgment. Based on these problems and current
situation, our group proposed a new system, which applies affective computing with existing
devices. By wearing corresponding devices, it can call the emergency contacts automatically
in correspond to a sudden emotion change. TheMachine Learning (ML) algorithms are also
applied in the system, which can highly enhance detection accuracy.
